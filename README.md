<h1>Titanic Survival Prediction</h1>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>This project involves analyzing the famous Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived the tragic event or not. The goal was to build a machine learning model that could accurately predict survival based on various features provided in the dataset, such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.</p>

<h4>Dataset</h4>
<p>The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which includes the following features:</p>

<li>PassengerId: A unique identifier for each passenger</li>
Pclass: Passenger's ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
