<h1>Titanic Survival Prediction</h1>
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing the famous Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived the tragic event or not. The goal was to build a machine learning model that could accurately predict survival based on various features provided in the dataset, such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which includes the following features:

PassengerId: A unique identifier for each passenger
Pclass: Passenger's ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
Name: Passenger's name
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Amount of money paid for the ticket
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) [Target variable]
Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
Model Training: Training Gradient Boosting Clasifier models to predict survival.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction: Using the model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.
