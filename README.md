<h1>Titanic Survival Prediction</h1>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>This project involves analyzing the famous Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived the tragic event or not. The goal was to build a machine learning model that could accurately predict survival based on various features provided in the dataset, such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.</p>

<h4>Dataset</h4>
<p>The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which includes the following features:</p>

<li>PassengerId: A unique identifier for each passenger</li>
<li></li>Pclass: Passenger's ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)</li>
<li>Name: Passenger's name</li>
<li>Sex: Gender of the passenger</li>
<li>Age: Age of the passenger</li>
<li>SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic</li>
<li>Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic</li>
<li>Ticket: Ticket number</li>
<li>Fare: Amount of money paid for the ticket</li>
<li>Cabin: Cabin number</li>
<li>Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)</li>
<li>Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) [Target variable]</li>
